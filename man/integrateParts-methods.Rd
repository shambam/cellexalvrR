\description{
integrate the parts that have been split from the main object.
This function is called by the loadObject function. Nothing the user has to think about!
}
\details{
The function integrateParts is one main part in the load and save speed up implemented for cellexalvrR.

Instead of saving all data in each VR script call only the modified data is saved.
This function loads all separately saved parts into the main cellexalvrR object.
